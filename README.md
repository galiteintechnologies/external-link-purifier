## Installation

If you use composer, you can add this package by running 

````
composer require nexuslinkservices/external-link-purifier
````

## Usage

i.e.:  I want to remove external links from my content, so I need to 
define following variables in my configuration yaml file.

```
external_link:
    purify: true    
```

```
Note(s): 
1. If configuration yaml is not there in your project then the default configuration will be taken into consideration.
2. The bundle uses symfony yaml component to parse the yaml configuration.
```

Following is the reference code to make it working,

```
/**
 * CODE

 * create a new object of LinkPurifier class
 * call purify method with 3 arguments
 * $content to purify links
 * $domain keep links of this domain and remove other external links (optional), If not specified remove all links
 * $purify true/false (optional)
 */

$linkPurifier = new LinkPurifier($pathToYaml);  //$pathToYaml is optional as mentioned earlier
$filteredContent = $linkPurifier->Purify($contentToBePurifyForLinks, $domainToKeep, $purify);
```

That's it with the bundle.
